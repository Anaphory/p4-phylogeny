Instructions for making a Python module from the Aarhus qdist code.

As usual, the hard part is getting the prerequisites properly in place.

You will need blas, or cblas, or Atlas with cblas.  This sort of thing
comes with a mac, but you may need to install it if you are using
linux.  If you compile Atlas yourself, follow the instructions
carefully, and make the shared libs (*.so).  I think on Ubuntu you can
install blas, which gives you blas rather than cblas (and no Atlas),
but where the header is cblas.h; adjust the instructions below
accordingly.

There is a boost-python library that would be needed as well.  On
Ubuntu its something like sudo apt-get install libboost-python.  I
suspect the rest of libboost is not needed -- I put it on my Ubuntu
box for other reasons, and it did not hurt.

Make sure you have Python.h in your include path.  You probably have
that if you installed Python from source, or from MacPorts, or if you
installed python-dev.

====================================================================

Now for scqdist, the sub-cubic quartet distance code from the clever
and helpful folks at BIRC at Aarhus.

Thanks muchly to Anders Kabell Kristensen (no longer at Aarhus, but
see http://www.cs.au.dk/~dalko/thesis/) and Jesper Nielsen for help
with the code.

Get the zip file, qdist-src-1.0.zip, from http://birc.au.dk/software/qdist/

Unzip it here in this directory, where the scqdistmodule.cpp and
setup.py are needed.

Modify Matrix.hpp, near the top, to read
//#include"include_blas.hpp"
extern "C" {
#include <cblas.h>
}

You may need to use <blas.h> above rather than <cblas.h>, but probably
not.  On my Ubuntu box it wants cblas.h even tho the lib is libblas,
not libcblas.

Do this ---

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

and pay attention to any error messages as they fly by.  (Warnings are
usually ok)

It might work.  If it does, you will get a module, scqdist.so

If it does not work, you may need to adjust your setup.py.  You may
need to remove the atlas lib from the list (I needed to do that on
Ubuntu), or you may need to uncomment and adjust the include_dirs and
library_dirs.  You may need to change "cblas" to "blas" (I needed to
do that on Ubuntu).  Try again until you get a working scqdist.so that
loads without error (ie in Python or p4, do "import scqdist" in that
directory), and then move that into your python path.

Use it like this ---
# tsA and tsB are two newick trees as Python strings.
import scqdist
mydist = scqdist.qdist(tsA, tsB)
