This makes the p4stm module, which is for fast calculation of RF distances between input trees and a supertree.  It is meant to be used by p4.STMcmc.py

This needs boost-python and boost dynamic-bitset.
It also needs PyUblas, from http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyublas   Using PyUblas, we can use the p4.Tree.postOrder numpy array directly in p4stm.

When I installed pyublas, the headers for it got put in an odd (for me, anyway) place, in 
~/lib/python/PyUblas-2011.1-py2.6-macosx-10.6-x86_64.egg/include -- I had to resort to the method described in 
http://documen.tician.de/pyublas/faq.html#where-do-the-headers-get-installed to find them.

To build the thing, do 

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

and look for error messages.  If you get error messages, it probably can't find something that it needs, which might be corrected by adjusting the setup.py file.  If it works, you get p4stm.so, which you can move into your python path, eg in the p4 modules directory.
